title: First blog post

This feels like tradition so I'm going to just modify the existing text and not change the title. I want to write a blog because I think (\emph{think}) that I have _something_ to say that interests people. This _something _may have something to do with **baking**, or with programming robots using the Robot Operating System (**[ROS](http://www.ros.org/)**), or it may just be a general rant about **programming**, **Linux**, or **life**. I had an old blog about baking ([Tandoori Spring](http://tandoorispring.wordpress.com))Â that unfortunately went nowhere after two posts. Hopefully this time it'll be different. Stay tuned, though I do not really expect anyone to start reading for a while :)
