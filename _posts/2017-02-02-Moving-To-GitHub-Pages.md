title: Switching to Jekyll and GitHub pages
---

Third time's the charm as they say. 

I tried twice with Wordpress first [writing about cooking](https://tandoorispring.wordpress.com/) and then [tech](https://jarisafi.wordpress.com/) but just couldn't continue writing. Now that I have a [GitHub pages homepage](https://safijari.github.io/) set up I decided to move the blog over to Jekyll and host it on GitHub. [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) was a huge help in getting started. It even does all the ground work for getting Disqus working for you and all you have to do is give it your Disqus sitename. Comments was the other reason I left Wordpress btw, a fair number of folks were coming to my posts but no one ever left a comment, which I'm assuming isn't a result of my sub-par writing and is instead related to the resistance posed by _YOU MUST POSSES A WORDPRESS ACCOUNT TO COMMENT_. Here's hoping using Disqus helps change that.

I will probably migrate my old posts over and am working on a new one about using Docker for development. Stay tuned!
