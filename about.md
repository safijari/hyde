Professionally, I am currently a member of the rather ill defined group of people known as <strong><em>roboticist</em></strong><em>s</em>. I am currently interning at <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">Mathworks</a> working with their <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/robotics/">Robotics System Toolbox</a> team. Prior to this I interned at a startup called <strong><a href="http://www.simberobotics.com/" target="_blank">Simbe Robotics</a> </strong>where I was hired for my experience with point cloud processing as well as my extensive knowledge of <a href="http://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System (<strong>ROS</strong>)</a>. I'm currently a senior computer vision engineer there.

My education consisted of an undergraduate degree in Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering from Idaho State University and a Masters in Mechanical Engineering from Penn State University. Earlier on my interest was primarily in thermal hydraulics for nuclear power plant but I slowly transitioned into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUSpz_WdiOI">Mechatronics</a> by the time I started grad school at Penn State. I did my graduate work with Drs. <a href="http://www.mne.psu.edu/department/directory-detail.aspx?LandOn=Gen&amp;q=hkf2">Hosam Fathy</a> and <a href="http://www.mne.psu.edu/department/directory-detail.aspx?LandOn=Gen&amp;q=snb10">Sean Brennan</a> initially with a focus on control and estiamtion in electric and hybrid electric vehicle battery packs. Parallel to this work I slowly learned about robotics through affiliation with <a href="http://mne.psu.edu/toboldlygo/">Dr. Brennan's Lab</a>, an effort that culminated in a one year long project with Volvo: a technology demonstration for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNIV6Dcj29E">trash collecting robots</a>. <br/><br/>

I write a blog about open source robotics software (among other things) called the <a href="jarisafi.wordpress.com">The Kidnapped Robot</a>. Please drop by, you might find something interesting to read :).
